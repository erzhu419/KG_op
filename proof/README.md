# SC-OLH-KG Lean4 Proof Workspace

This directory is the local proof workspace for the current `KG_op` project.
It is intentionally kept at the project root instead of being moved into any
external proof directory.

Lean4 is the source of truth for formal proofs.  Markdown files are only the
human-readable roadmap and code-to-theory map.

## Build

```bash
cd proof
lake build
```

The project now depends on mathlib `v4.31.0`.  The first build may download
mathlib and its cache; later builds should be fast.

## Core Files

- `SCOLHKG/Variance.lean`: formal cumulative-risk algebra, including the
  `A^T Lambda A + N^T B N + N^T omega + floor` decomposition and truncation
  bookkeeping lemmas.
- `SCOLHKG/Information.lean`: formal algebraic core of the information
  refinement proposition.
- `SCOLHKG/Certification.lean`: formal ordered-arithmetic core of conservative
  chance certification.
- `SCOLHKG/Scalarization.lean`: inherited bi-objective-to-scalar bridge:
  weak Pareto dominance is preserved by nonnegative weighted scalarization.
- `SCOLHKG/HVD.lean`: deterministic oracle-inequality and conservative
  variance-estimation skeleton for HVD.
- `SCOLHKG/Optimization.lean`: safe recommendation and simple-regret
  consequences once mean confidence and variance upper bounds hold.
- `SCOLHKG/KG.lean`: exact KG maximizer bookkeeping and the condition under
  which an additive KG proxy is exact.
- `SCOLHKG/Real/CumulativeRisk.lean`: real-valued cumulative-risk algebra.
- `SCOLHKG/Real/ConditionalVariance.lean`: finite-partition law of total
  variance over real numbers, proved by algebraic expansion.
- `SCOLHKG/Real/Certification.lean`: real-valued GP-confidence plus variance
  upper-bound certification implication.
- `SCOLHKG/Real/HVD.lean`: real-valued residual-square concentration event to
  HVD oracle-inequality implication.
- `SCOLHKG/Real/KG.lean`: real-valued exact KG and additive-proxy relation.
- `SCOLHKG/Real/SafeRegret.lean`: real-valued finite-budget safe simple-regret
  implication.
- `theory.md`: theorem statements, assumptions, and proof sketches for the
  manuscript-level theory.
- `code_map.md`: mapping from mathematical objects to the current
  `SC-OLH-KG/` implementation.

## Formalization Status

Implemented in Lean4 without `sorry`, `admit`, or `axiom`:

1. Fixed-trajectory cumulative variance decomposition algebra.
2. Information-refinement reduction of apparent variance as algebraic lemma.
3. Low-rank/effective-risk truncation bookkeeping lemmas.
4. Conservative chance-feasibility certification arithmetic.
5. Weighted scalarization monotonicity for the inherited bi-objective bridge.
6. Deterministic HVD oracle-inequality skeleton.
7. Safe recommendation and safe simple-regret implication.
8. Exact KG/additive-surrogate bookkeeping.
9. Real-valued cumulative-risk decomposition and truncation lemmas.
10. Two-cell and arbitrary finite-partition laws of total variance, including
    the information-refinement variance-reduction corollary.
11. Real-valued chance certification from GP confidence plus conservative
    standard-deviation upper bound.
12. Real-valued residual-square concentration event to HVD oracle bound.
13. Real-valued exact KG/additive-proxy theorem.
14. Real-valued finite-budget safe simple-regret implication.

Still to formalize at the deeper mathlib probability/analysis layer:

1. General conditional variance over arbitrary probability spaces, beyond the
   current finite-partition expansion.
2. Random-policy occupancy-risk decomposition using conditional expectation.
3. Concentration proof for HVD residual-square estimation, deriving the
   `ResidualSquareConcentration.Valid` event.
4. GP/posterior confidence event for constraint and objective means, deriving
   `GPConfidenceEvent.Valid`.
5. Exact SC-OLH-KG one-step value-of-information theorem over posterior
   expectations, not only the deterministic maximizer theorem.
6. Finite-budget safe simple-regret bound with information gain, deriving the
   optimization-error premise.

## Current Math-Depth Assessment

This is not yet a 10/10 mathematical package, but it is no longer only a
Lean-core bookkeeping layer.  It now has a mathlib-backed real-valued proof
layer.  A 10/10 version still needs the probability layer that derives the
events currently consumed by the real theorems: GP confidence,
residual-square concentration, posterior KG value, and information-gain regret.
