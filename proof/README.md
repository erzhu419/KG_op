# SC-OLH-KG Lean4 Proof Workspace

This directory is the local proof workspace for the current `KG_op` project.
It is intentionally kept at the project root instead of being moved into any
external proof directory.

Lean4 is the source of truth for formal proofs.  Markdown files are only the
human-readable roadmap and code-to-theory map.

## Build

```bash
cd proof
lake build
```

The current Lean layer is dependency-free and uses Lean core only.  This keeps
the algebraic proof skeleton fast and reproducible before adding mathlib's real
analysis and probability machinery.

## Core Files

- `SCOLHKG/Variance.lean`: formal cumulative-risk algebra, including the
  `A^T Lambda A + N^T B N + N^T omega + floor` decomposition and truncation
  bookkeeping lemmas.
- `SCOLHKG/Information.lean`: formal algebraic core of the information
  refinement proposition.
- `SCOLHKG/Certification.lean`: formal ordered-arithmetic core of conservative
  chance certification.
- `theory.md`: theorem statements, assumptions, and proof sketches for the
  manuscript-level theory.
- `code_map.md`: mapping from mathematical objects to the current
  `SC-OLH-KG/` implementation.

## Formalization Status

Implemented in Lean4 without `sorry`, `admit`, or `axiom`:

1. Fixed-trajectory cumulative variance decomposition algebra.
2. Information-refinement reduction of apparent variance as algebraic lemma.
3. Low-rank/effective-risk truncation bookkeeping lemmas.
4. Conservative chance-feasibility certification arithmetic.

Still to formalize after introducing mathlib probability/analysis:

1. Random-policy occupancy-risk decomposition with conditional variance.
2. HVD estimation oracle inequality.
3. Exact SC-OLH-KG one-step value-of-information theorem.
4. Finite-budget safe simple-regret bound.
